HGCal reconstruction hands-on <br/>
This repository contains the notebooks used in the reconstruction hands-on session. The following packages are required: <br/>
**numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, tqdm, matplotlib, pytorch, pytorch-geometric** <br/>
There are three notebooks and their short descriptions are below: <br/>
**school_shower_properties_full.ipynb** : This notebook demonstrates how to calculate shower properties from simulated detector data and compare different kinds of showers <br/>
**school_reco_full.ipynb** : This notebook demonstrates different algorithms used for clustering particle showers <br/>
**school_pid_training_full.ipynb** : This notebook demonstrates the use of latest graph neural networks to distinguish between different kinds of showers. A complete example of how to create graph datasets, train and infer using saved models to plot performance curves. <br/>
For installation guide please look at the setup pdf <br/>
